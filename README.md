The motivation behind this project stems from the growing popularity of pet ownership and the increasing demand for pet products and services. With the rise of
e-commerce, there is an opportunity to provide a more personalized and engaging shopping experience for pet owners. By accurately identifying a dog’s breed, the
system can offer tailored recommendations for products that are best suited for the breed’s unique characteristics, ensuring the well-being of the pet and satisfying the
owner’s needs.
Additionally, accurate breed prediction can aid in understanding a dog’s genetic traits, behavior, and healthcare requirements, which can be valuable information for 
responsible pet ownership and veterinary care.
Furthermore, the integration of breed prediction capabilities into an e-commerce platform can foster customer engagement and loyalty, as users can interact with the
system by uploading images of their dogs and receiving personalized recommendations based on the predicted breed.
